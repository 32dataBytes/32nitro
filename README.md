# Disclaimer
I cannot guarantee any of the Nitro Tokens generated work, and I assume no responsibility for any issues that may occur. You can visit our help server above
It works by generating random keys and saving them to a list, with the slight chance a key happens to be active and contains Nitro. Saves manual labour.
